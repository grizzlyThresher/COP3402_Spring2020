## Compiling the Lexer

To compile, just run "make" in your terminal from the Lexer directory, that will compile everything in the
Lexer directory and provide the lexer program.

## Running the Lexer

You have several options for running the Lexer:

1. You may run "./lexer NAME_OF_INPUT_FILE" from your terminal. This will read in your input file
	and print the results to a file labelled "output.txt".

2. You may run "./lexer NAME_OF_INPUT_FILE NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE" from your terminal.
	This will read in your input file and print the results to the given output file.
	WARNING: If you give an already existing filename for OUTPUT_FILE, it will get overwritten
	with the program data, so be careful what you use.

3. You may run "./lexer display NAME_OF_INPUT_FILE" from your terminal. This will read in your input
	file and print the results to the terminal.

NOTE: All commands must be executed from the Lexer directory after compilation.
